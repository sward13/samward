					<a href="https://www.revealnews.org/" target="_blank">Reveal</a> is the online home of The Center for Investigative Reporting’s award-winning journalism. The design provides a clean, minimal layout optimized for readability across all platforms, and is perfectly suited for Reveal’s long-form work. A persistent audio player facilitates extended listening and doesn’t force a reload between pages. Reveal won the Edgar R. Murrow award for general excellence in 2016.
