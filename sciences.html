				<div class="project_contents"><h3>Amplify chatbot</h3>
					One of Reveal's goals was to convert their audience of podcast listeners into readers of their longform journalism. As people listen to the show, they can text the chatbot at key moments to dig deeper in the story, and receive additional content, such as a photograph, key documents, or other interactive content providing more context to the story. This project grew out of Reveal's collaboration with the d.school at Stanford University. Amplify received an Edgar R. Murrow award for Excellence in Innovation.

					Media organizations are always looking to measure and analyze the impact of their work. I collaborated with our Director of Strategic Research to develop the Impact Tracker. This online database allows for consistent recording and analysis of media impact at the structural, societal, and individual level. A histogram timeline lets organizations visualize their impact over time.
